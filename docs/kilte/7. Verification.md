# Verification (Validation) üéØ

In this section, we will collectively undertake the roles of the `Verifier` individual.

![alternative text](../../static/img/kilt/verify-me.jpg "Welcome")

These processes include:

- üì• We will receive the `Presentation` object provided by the `Claimer`.
- üßê We will verify the accuracy of the information within this data.
- üîó You will confirm whether the `attestation` process is correct by checking the hash value on the chain. This attestation might also have been revoked. This situation needs to be considered as well.
- ü§î You will ensure that the Claimer sent the identity document.

:::tip üéâ Presentation: Now, am I supposed to prepare a PowerPoint presentation too?
A `Presentation` is a document produced using a `credential`. Unlike a `credential`, a `presentation` can hide some of its documents. These are pieces of information that the `verifiers` don't need to know. This `presentation` also proves that the `credential` belongs to the `Claimer`.
:::

:::info ü§ì What was Verification again? Shall we recall?

üîç When a Claimer receives an attested Credential, they can store it in their wallets. But how can we determine its validity if there's no copy of this credential?

üîí KILT provides a Verifier with the opportunity to verify the accuracy and validity of the information presented in a credential by a Claimer.

üí° The Verifier trusts this third party directly based on their reputation or through a delegation structure involving the Attester.

‚úÖ For the verification process:

üîë The Claimer needs a private key associated with the credential and their identifiers.

üîí The Verifier needs the identifier of the Attester they trust.

üîé During the verification process, the Claimer aims to prove three things to the Verifier:

1Ô∏è‚É£ The credential is valid and has not been revoked by the Attester.
2Ô∏è‚É£ The attributes specified in the credential genuinely belong to the Claimer.
3Ô∏è‚É£ The credential contains the information relevant to the Verifier for a specific use case.
:::

## üé® Creating the Presentation

We need to find a way to send the Claimer and wait for the Verifier to verify it. The Claimer also needs to prove that they own this `credential`. To prove this ownership, they need to create and sign a `presentation`.

### üì¶ Package Inclusions:

```typescript title="claimer/createPresentation.ts"
import * as Kilt from '@kiltprotocol/sdk-js'
```
This line incorporates the KILT SDK into the project. This SDK provides the necessary functions and classes to interact with the KILT protocol.

### **üõ† `createPresentation` Function**:

```typescript title="claimer/createPresentation.ts"
export async function createPresentation(
  credential: Kilt.ICredential,
  signCallback: Kilt.SignCallback,
  challenge?: string
): Promise<Kilt.ICredentialPresentation> {
```
This function is an asynchronous function to create a credential presentation. It takes three parameters:

- `credential`: The credential that will be presented to the Verifier.
- `signCallback`: The callback function to sign the credential presentation.
- `challenge`: An optional parameter. This is a random string requested by the verifier and is used to confirm that the verifier asked the credential presentation.

The function returns an `ICredentialPresentation` object, which is the credential presentation itself.

### **üé® Creating the Presentation**:

```typescript title="claimer/createPresentation.ts"
return Kilt.Credential.createPresentation({
    credential,
    signCallback,
    challenge
  })
```
This section creates a credential presentation using the `Kilt.Credential.createPresentation` function. This function takes the three parameters mentioned above and returns a credential presentation.

:::note üåç Let's take a broader look
If we want to understand the function by looking at the entire code:

```typescript title="claimer/createPresentation.ts"
import * as Kilt from '@kiltprotocol/sdk-js'

export async function createPresentation(
  credential: Kilt.ICredential,
  signCallback: Kilt.SignCallback,
  challenge?: string
): Promise<Kilt.ICredentialPresentation> {
  // Create the presentation from credential, DID, and challenge.
  return Kilt.Credential.createPresentation({
    credential,
    signCallback,
    challenge
  })
}
```
In summary, this code enables the creation of a credential presentation. This presentation is used when presenting a credential to a verifier. Using this presentation, the verifier can verify the credential's validity and the identity of the credential's owner.
:::
## Verify (Validation)

Now, let's write our `verification` code. First, we'll create a function named `getChallenge` to prove that the `Claimer` has the `credential` by signing it.

Then, we'll perform the validation or `verification` process with the `verifyPresentation` function. We will use the `verify.ts` file for these operations.

### **Package and Module Imports**

```typescript title="verify.ts"
import { config as envConfig } from 'dotenv'
import * as Kilt from '@kiltprotocol/sdk-js'
import { createPresentation } from './claimer/createPresentation'
import { generateKeypairs } from './claimer/generateKeypairs'
import { generateLightDid } from './claimer/generateLightDid'
```

In this section, the necessary modules and packages are imported. In particular, environment variables are loaded using `dotenv`, and the KILT SDK and other helper functions are included.

### **Generating a Unique Challenge**

```typescript title="verify.ts"
function getChallenge(): string {
  return Kilt.Utils.UUID.generate()
}
```

This function generates a unique challenge for the verification process.

![alternative text](../../static/img/kilt/chosen.gif "Welcome")

### **Presentation Verification Function**

```typescript title="verify.ts"
async function verifyPresentation(
  presentation: Kilt.ICredentialPresentation,
  challenge: string,
  trustedAttesterUris: Kilt.DidUri[]
): Promise<boolean> {
```

We can start the process by creating a function for verification. This function takes in 3 parameters and returns a `Promise` with a value of `True` or `False`. Looking at these parameters one by one:

1. `presentation`: The credential presentation to be verified.
2. `challenge`: The unique value sent by the Verifier (Verifier). This is used to confirm that the credential presentation was requested by the verifier.
3. `trustedAttesterUris`: The list of DID URIs of Attesters (Attester) trusted by the verifier.

This function verifies a credential presentation. It checks if the presentation is valid, its ownership, and if the attestation is correct.

#### Access to the KILT API:

```typescript title="verify.ts"
Kilt.ConfigService.get('api')
```

This line provides access to the KILT API.

#### Try Catch Structure

```typescript title="verify.ts"
try {
	.
	.
	.
  } catch {
    return false
  }
```

Upon entering the structure, we first encounter a `try` `catch` structure. This structure checks if the `attestation` is correct. If it's not correct, the structure is caught by the `catch` block, and it's understood that the `attestation` is not on the chain with a value of `false`.

#### Verifying the Presentation:

```typescript title="verify.ts"
const { revoked, attester } = await Kilt.Credential.verifyPresentation(
  presentation,
  { challenge }
)
```

Inside the Try structure, we are greeted by the `Kilt.Credential.verifyPresentation` function, which performs the actual verification. This function takes in 2 variables. These are the presented `presentation` and the `challenge` values to prove that the Claimer is the correct individual.

This function returns 2 values. These values indicate whether the `attestation` has been `revoked`, i.e., lost its validity, and who the attester of the presentation is.

```typescript title="verify.ts"
if (revoked) {
  return false
}
```

If the `revoke` value is `true`, i.e., if the `credential` has lost its validity, the `verification` value is given as output as `false`.

```typescript title="verify.ts"
return trustedAttesterUris.includes(attester)
```

This line checks if the presenter (`attester`) is on the list of trusted attestors (`trustedAttesterUris`). If the attester is on this list, the function returns `true`; otherwise, it returns `false`.

:::danger
One of the most important attributes a Verifier needs to check is whether or not they trust an `attester`. If they don't trust, they may not accept the document, whether the `attestation` is on the chain or not. This situation creates a trust race among the `attesters`.
:::

### **Verification Flow**

```typescript title="verify.ts"
export async function verificationFlow(
  credential: Kilt.ICredential,
  signCallback: Kilt.SignCallback,
  trustedAttesterUris: Kilt.DidUri[] = []
) {
```

This function manages the verification process. Firstly, it generates a challenge, then creates a presentation, and finally verifies the presentation. This function takes in 3 parameters. Looking at these parameters one by one:

1. `credential: Kilt.ICredential`: The credential to be presented to the Verifier.
2. `signCallback: Kilt.SignCallback`: The callback function to sign the credential presentation.
3. `trustedAttesterUris: Kilt.DidUri[]`: The list of DID URIs of Attesters (Attester) trusted by the verifier. It's an optional parameter and starts with an empty list by default.

:::caution What's the Difference Between verificationFlow and verifyPresentation?
By creating this function, we manage the entire `verification` process in one place.

The `verificationFlow` function represents a broader verification process that includes the `verifyPresentation` function. The `verifyPresentation` function alone only checks the validity of a credential presentation. However, in the real world, a verification process requires more than just checking the validity of a presentation. That's why we need the `verificationFlow` function.

The objectives of the `verificationFlow` function are:

1. **Generating a Unique Challenge:** The Verifier sends a unique challenge to the Claimer. This is used to ensure that the presentation is created in real-time and for a specific request.
   
2. **Creating the Presentation:** Using this challenge, the Claimer creates and signs the credential presentation.

3. **Verifying the Presentation:** The Verifier verifies the presentation received from the Claimer with the `verifyPresentation` function.

4. **Reporting the Results:** If the presentation is correct, the verifier prints a successful verification message. Otherwise, it prints a failed verification message.

Each of these steps is a critical component of a decentralized identity verification process. The `verifyPresentation` function is just a part of this process. The `verificationFlow` function brings these steps together to provide a complete verification process. That's why we need not only the `verifyPresentation` function but also the `verificationFlow` function that combines these steps.
:::

Sure, let's continue with the English translation:

#### Generating a Unique Challenge

```typescript title="verify.ts"
const challenge = getChallenge()
```

This line generates a unique challenge to be sent to the Claimer. This ensures that the presentation is created in real-time and for a specific request. We had previously defined this function.

#### Creating the Credential Presentation

```typescript title="verify.ts"
const presentation = await createPresentation(
    credential,
    signCallback,
    challenge
)
```

This line creates a credential presentation using the provided credential, signature callback function, and challenge. We had previously defined this function in the `claimer` folder.

#### Verifying the Presentation:

```typescript title="verify.ts"
const isValid = await verifyPresentation(
    presentation,
    challenge,
    trustedAttesterUris
)
```

This line verifies the created credential presentation. If the presentation is valid, the `isValid` value will be `true`.

#### Reporting the Results:

```typescript title="verify.ts"
if (isValid) {
    console.log('Verification successful! You are allowed to enter the club üéâ')
} else {
    console.log('Verification failed! üö´')
}
```

This section prints a message based on the validity of the presentation. If the presentation is valid, a successful verification message is printed. Otherwise, a failed verification message is printed.

:::info What Does the Function Do?
When we look inside the `verificationFlow()` function, we essentially execute the functions we previously wrote. Sequentially:
- We generate a `Challenge` to authenticate the Claimer.
- The Claimer creates a `presentation`.
- As a `Verifier`, we verify the presented authentication.
:::

### Main Function

This section contains the main function that will execute when the file is run directly. It loads environment variables, connects to KILT, and initiates the verification flow.

```typescript title="verify.ts"
if (require.main === module) {
  ;(async () => {
```

This `if` structure checks if the module is being run directly.

#### Loading Environment Variables:

```typescript title="verify.ts"
envConfig()
```

This line loads the environment variables from the `.env` file. This is used to store various configuration values used in the project.

#### Connecting to KILT:

```typescript title="verify.ts"
await Kilt.connect(process.env.WSS_ADDRESS as string)
```

This line establishes a connection to the KILT network. The connection address is retrieved from the `.env` file.

#### Generating Claimer's DID Information:

```typescript title="verify.ts"
const claimerDidMnemonic = process.env.CLAIMER_DID_MNEMONIC as string
const { authentication } = generateKeypairs(claimerDidMnemonic)
const claimerDid = generateLightDid(claimerDidMnemonic)
```

These steps are used to generate the Claimer's DID (Decentralized Identifier) information. This is required to sign the credential presentation.

:::caution
As you might have noticed, when querying the Claimer's DID, we executed a new `Light DID` generation function. The reason for this is that `light DID`s, which are not stored on-chain, are open to being regenerated each time.
:::

The `verificationFlow()` function also runs the `presentation` creation function. Therefore, we need the Claimer's DID.

#### Loading Attester's DID Information:

```typescript title="verify.ts"
const attesterDid = process.env.ATTESTER_DID_URI as Kilt.DidUri
```

This line retrieves the Attester's DID URI from the `.env` file.

#### Loading the Credential:

```typescript title="verify.ts"
const credential = JSON.parse(process.env.CLAIMER_CREDENTIAL as string)
```

This line loads the `Credential` that we previously obtained by running our code in the `attestation` section and saved in the `.env` file.

#### Initiating the Verification Flow:

```typescript title="verify.ts"
await verificationFlow(
  credential,
  async ({ data }) => ({
    signature: authentication.sign(data),
    keyType: authentication.type,
    keyUri: `${claimerDid.uri}${claimerDid.authentication[0].id}`
  }),
  [attesterDid]
)
```

This line calls the previously defined `verificationFlow` function to start the verification process.

#### Error Handling:

```typescript title="verify.ts"
} catch (e) {
  console.log('Error in the verification flow')
  throw e
}
```

This section catches any errors that might occur during the verification process and prints an error message.

:::info Overview of the Code
When we look at the entirety of the code:

```typescript title="verify.ts"
import { config as envConfig } from 'dotenv'
import * as Kilt from '@kiltprotocol/sdk-js'
import { createPresentation } from './claimer/createPresentation'
import { generateKeypairs } from './claimer/generateKeypairs'

function getChallenge(): string {
  return Kilt.Utils.UUID.generate()
}

// Verifies validity, ownership & attestation.
async function verifyPresentation(

  challenge: string,
  trustedAttesterUris: Kilt.DidUri[]
): Promise<boolean> {
  Kilt.ConfigService.get('api')

  try {
    const { revoked, attester } = await Kilt.Credential.verifyPresentation(
      presentation,
      { challenge }
    )

    if (revoked) {
      return false
    }
    return trustedAttesterUris.includes(attester)
  } catch {
    return false
  }
}

export async function verificationFlow(
  credential: Kilt.ICredential,

) {
  const challenge = getChallenge()
  const presentation = await createPresentation(

  )
  const isValid = await verifyPresentation(
    presentation,
    challenge,
    trustedAttesterUris
  )

  if (isValid) {
    console.log('Verification successful! You are allowed to enter the club üéâ')
  } else {
    console.log('Verification failed! üö´')
  }
}

if (require.main === module) {
  ;(async () => {
    envConfig()

    try {
      await Kilt.connect(process.env.WSS_ADDRESS as string)
      const claimerDidMnemonic = process.env.CLAIMER_DID_MNEMONIC as string
      const { authentication } = generateKeypairs(claimerDidMnemonic)
      const claimerDid = generateLightDid(claimerDidMnemonic)
      const attesterDid = process.env.ATTESTER_DID_URI as Kilt.DidUri
      const credential = JSON.parse(process.env.CLAIMER_CREDENTIAL as string)
      await verificationFlow(
        credential,
        async ({ data }) => ({
          signature: authentication.sign(data),
          keyType: authentication.type,
          keyUri: `${claimerDid.uri}${claimerDid.authentication[0].id}`
        }),
        [attesterDid]
      )
    } catch (e) {
      console.log('Error in the verification flow')
      throw e
    }
  })()
}
```

The functions, in order:
- Packages are imported.
- A `challenge` is generated for the Claimer to prove they possess the `credential`.
- A `Presentation` verification function is written, which outputs either `True` or `False`.
- The `verificationFlow()` function is written to execute all processes from start to finish.
- A function is written to specify what the function will do when run on its own.
