# Creating the Attester Account 🏢

Let's get started! In the previous step, we set up the necessary file locations. Now, it's time to create the account of our `Attester` character on the blockchain. 🎉

:::caution Do you have an Attester address?
There are two main components here: the `public address` and, of course, the `mnemonic passphrase`. If you've already created these details using a virtual wallet on testnet, there's no need to create a new account. 🎯
:::

An account on the KILT blockchain is one of the main components that interact with the blockchain. 🌐 This account has various features. One of them is the `address`, the account address. 💳 This address is used to pay transaction fees and deposits.

:::note 📒 KILT Account
A KILT account is essentially a combination of several cryptographic elements:
- A public address 🌐
- A key pair for signing 🔑
:::

:::tip 🎓 MNEMONIC
The mnemonic passphrase usually consists of 12, 18, or 24 words. 📝 It provides access to your wallet and assets. For instance, it could be something like "apple candle mountain bicycle flower". It's critical for security, so it's crucial to keep this passphrase safe! 🔒

## Creating the Account 🛠️

We use the `addFromMnemonic()` function on the KiltKeyringPair class to create an account. 🌟 This generates a 12-word mnemonic passphrase for us.

:::info 📘 Polkadot.js
The KILT SDK is built on the `polkadot.js` library. 🛠️ You'll encounter it frequently in your work. This library offers many useful features for KILT and other `substrate-based` blockchains. 🌐

### Let's Start Coding

Now that we've learned the basics and understand why we're doing what we're doing, we can start coding:

#### Library Integration

```typescript title="attester/genarateAccount.ts"
import { config as envConfig } from "dotenv"

import * as Kilt from "@kiltprotocol/sdk-js"
```

First, as is necessary in other software projects, we integrate our libraries into our code. If we examine these lines of code one by one:

- First, we start by calling the `envConfig` method from the `dotenv` library as `config`. Thanks to this library, we can access data saved in an external `.env` file within our code using the `config` keyword.
- On the next line, we see that all features of the KILT SDK are called from the `@kiltprotcol/sdk-js` library and named as `Kilt`. The `*` structure in this line indicates that we're integrating all the code from the library, while the `as Kilt` structure allows us to access it using the name `Kilt` without using the long library name `@kiltprotocol/sdk-js` every time.

### The `generateAccount` Function

```typescript title="attester/genarateAccount.ts"
export function generateAccount(
  mnemonic = Kilt.Utils.Crypto.mnemonicGenerate()
): {
  account: Kilt.KiltKeyringPair
  mnemonic: string
} {
```

After adding our libraries, we can proceed. The first operation in this function is to create the `mnemonic` key. The `generateAccount()` function shown above does precisely this. If we examine it step by step:

- First, we create a function that can be accessed from outside the code using the export method. We can give this function any name we want, but for now, we've named it `generateAccount()`.
- On the next line, for the first time, we access the KILT SDK in our code. Here, we define a variable named `mnemonic` using the `mnemonicGenerate()` method from the `Utils.Crypto` package of the KILT SDK. This way, we generate the mnemonic key.
- In the next line, we encounter a structure `:{ ... }` that might be unfamiliar. This structure is used to define the type of value the function will return. Inside this structure:
	- The line `account: Kilt.KiltKeyringPair` indicates that the returned object will have a property named `account`, and its type will be `Kilt.KiltKeyringPair`. This value represents the key pair used for signing operations, which we briefly mentioned earlier.
	- The line `mnemonic: string` indicates that the returned object will have another property named `mnemonic`, and its type will be a `string`. This is the mnemonic passphrase we're trying to generate.

```typescript title="attester/genarateAccount.ts"
  const keyring = new Kilt.Utils.Keyring({
    ss58Format: 38,
    type: 'sr25519'
  })
```

The next code structure within our function is the creation of the `keyring` variable. This structure is written right after the code discussed above and creates the keyring value.

:::info What is a keyring?
The term `keyring` in the code is used to create a keyring. A keyring is a data structure that facilitates the management of various key pairs (public and private keys). This structure is typically used to securely and efficiently store and manage keys for cryptographic operations.
:::

If we examine it line by line:
- First, we see that a new object is created from the `Kilt.Utils.Keyring` method and assigned to the `keyring` variable. This object has two parameters:
	- `ss58Format`: Specifies the format in which the key is encoded. SS58 is commonly used in Substrate-based blockchains. We've set its value to `38` for now.
	- `type`: Specifies the user's cryptographic algorithm. We've chosen the value `sr25519` here, which is commonly used in Substrate-based blockchains.

```typescript title="attester/genarateAccount.ts"
  return {
    account: keyring.addFromMnemonic(mnemonic) as Kilt.KiltKeyringPair, mnemonic
  }
}
```

The final stage of our function is the `return` structure, which provides an output. This output is the `account` of the `Attester`. It contains two values:
- The `addFromMnemonic(mnemonic)` method creates a key pair using the given mnemonic passphrase and adds it to the `keyring`.
- The `mnemonic` value is used to save the mnemonic passphrase of the address.

With this, we've created our account. All we need to do now is call the function and ensure it works correctly.

#### Main Program Section

We need a structure to call the function we created in the upper section. This structure indicates what will happen when the code runs standalone without other modules.

```typescript title="attester/genarateAccount.ts"
if (require.main === module) {
  ;(async () => {
    envConfig()
```

As indicated above, we first check if the running file is the main program within an `if` loop. If it's the main program, we call the `envConfig` value to integrate our data from the `.env` file into our project.

```typescript title="attester/genarateAccount.ts"
    try {
      await Kilt.init()
      .
      .
      .
    }catch (e){
	    console.log('Error while setting up attester account') 
	    throw e
    }
    })() 
}
```

Then, within the `if` function, we try to start the `KILT-SDK` with a `try` structure. All the code we continue to write will be located within this `try` structure.

When we go further down, we see a `catch` structure to detect and print errors to the console.

```typescript title="attester/genarateAccount.ts"
      const { mnemonic, account } = generateAccount()
```

Inside the try structure, we see that we call our `generateAccount` function and save the `mnemonic` and `account` values from it into a variable.

```typescript title="attester/genarateAccount.ts"
       console.log('Save to .env file before proceeding!\n\n')
       console.log(`ATTESTER_ACCOUNT_MNEMONIC="${mnemonic}"`)
       console.log(`ATTESTER_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS="${account.address}"\n\n`)
```

The above-mentioned code writes these values one by one to the terminal.

:::info
Let's look at how the `generateAccount.ts` file we wrote operates with all the code together.

```typescript title="attester/generateAccount.ts"
import { config as envConfig } from 'dotenv'

import * as Kilt from '@kiltprotocol/sdk-js'

export function generateAccount(
  mnemonic = Kilt.Utils.Crypto.mnemonicGenerate()
): {
  account: Kilt.KiltKeyringPair
  mnemonic: string
} {
  const keyring = new Kilt.Utils.Keyring({
    ss58Format: 38,
    type: 'sr25519'
  })
  return {
    account: keyring.addFromMnemonic(mnemonic) as Kilt.KiltKeyringPair,
    mnemonic
  }
}

// Don't execute if this is imported by another file.
if (require.main === module) {
  ;(async () => {
    envConfig()

    try {
      await Kilt.init()

      const { mnemonic, account } = generateAccount()
      console.log('save to mnemonic and address to .env to continue!\n\n')
      console.log(`ATTESTER_ACCOUNT_MNEMONIC="${mnemonic}"`)
      console.log(`ATTESTER_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS="${account.address}"\n\n`)
    } catch (e) {
      console.log('Error while setting up attester account')
      throw e
    }
  })()
}
```


- **Environment Configuration**: The code imports the `dotenv` package to manage environment variables, allowing for the configuration of settings outside the codebase.
  
- **KILT SDK Integration**: The code imports the KILT SDK, which is a toolkit for building decentralized identity and credential systems.
  
- **Account Generation Function**: The `generateAccount` function is defined to:
  - Generate a mnemonic if none is provided. A mnemonic is a series of words that represent a private key.
  - Use the generated or provided mnemonic to create a new account using KILT's keyring utilities.
  - Return both the account and the mnemonic.
  
- **Execution Block**: If this script is run directly (not imported elsewhere):
  - It initializes the KILT SDK.
  - It generates a new account using the `generateAccount` function.
  - It prints out the mnemonic and account address, suggesting the user save them to the `.env` file for future use.
  
- **Error Handling**: If any errors occur during the execution, they are caught, logged, and then re-thrown.

In essence, this script is a utility for setting up a new account on the KILT network, providing the user with the necessary mnemonic and account address to continue their operations.

### Let's Run Our Code!

Now we can run our code to obtain the `address` and `mnemonic` passphrase of our `Attester` character.

To run the code, make sure you're in the `kilt-rocks` folder in the terminal, then run the following code:

```bash
yarn ts-node ./attester/generateAccount.ts
```

:::caution Don't Forget to Save!
The values printed to the console need to be copied and saved to the `.env` file in the same format.
:::

```dotenv title="dotenv"
WSS_ADDRESS=wss://peregrine.kilt.io
ATTESTER_ACCOUNT_MNEMONIC="MNEMONIC PASSPHRASE"
ATTESTER_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS="ADDRESS"
```

:::danger We're now ready to get PILT Coins!
Now that we've created our accounts, we have a structure to pay transaction fees and deposits. But there's one thing missing: what we'll pay with! To do this, you can enter the `account_address` value generated when the code runs [into this link](https://faucet.peregrine.kilt.io/) and transfer from the `faucet`.
