# CType 🎯

`CType`, or Claim Type, is a specific term for the KILT protocol. In essence, it's a simple concept: `CType` is the data model of a `claim`. 📊

:::info 🌟 A Glimpse at CType 🌟

- KILT provides self-sovereign, verifiable credentials and DIDs for businesses and consumers. 🛡️ But what kind of credentials are we talking about? 🤔🔐

- How can we store our credentials? 🗂️ Is there a specific form we need to fill out? 📝 We'll answer all these questions! 😎👍

- Let's say you want to get some data verified. 📋 This data contains smaller pieces like your name, location. So, how will you present this data to a verifier? 🤷‍♂️ In which template? 📑

- Meet CTypes! 🎉 CTypes are the schemas of credentials. 📋 They can serve as the "form-building tools" you need. 🛠️

- CTypes are KILT-specific data types that define the structure of a claim, including its data model. 📊✅ They are based on JSON Schema, which is a standard used to describe and validate JSON documents. 📜

- You can create your own CTypes 🛠️ and store them on-chain or use existing CTypes on-chain to meet your needs. 💡🔗
:::

Attesters, before making an `attest` or `verification`, must determine which `CType` format they will support. 🎯 For instance, driving schools can only verify related to driving licenses; they can't verify something related to the living area of a house. 🚗🏠

:::tip 🌠
CTypes are intended to be standardized. 🎯 It's highly recommended to use existing ones before creating a new CType. 👍
:::

In the workshop, we'll create our own CType to learn the process! 🛠️🎉

:::note 📝
CType ensures that all necessary information is present within a `credential`. 🛡️ For instance, a driving license contains birth date, name, and the type of vehicle one is allowed to drive. 🚗📅 These pieces of information are necessary for the police officer checking our license to verify us. 🚓👮‍♂️
:::

To create a CType, a `full DID` is required on-chain. 🆔 Also, we should ensure that there are `PILT` coins in this account because creating a CType will charge us a certain amount. 💰

## Let's look at an example CType

For a better understanding, let's examine an example CType, and for this, we can again use the driving license as an example:

```json
{
  "$id": "kilt:CType:0x4f1d68ac46daf4613181b33b16faaf10cf94879dc2246d7485dc2ccbb843641d",
  "$schema": "ipfs://bafybeiah66wbkhqbqn7idkostj2iqyan2tstc4tpqt65udlhimd7hcxjyq/",
  "additionalProperties": false,
  "properties": {
    "age": {
      "type": "integer"
    },
    "id": {
      "type": "string"
    },
    "name": {
      "type": "string"
    }
  },
  "title": "Drivers License by did:kilt:4t9FPVbcN42UMxt3Z2Y4Wx38qPL8bLduAB11gLZSwn5hVEfH",
  "type": "object"
}
```

:::tip
If you look at the code structure above, you can see that it resembles the `JSON` format, and you'd be right. At their core, CTypes are designed as JavaScript Objects (`JSON`).

Breaking down the attributes line by line:

| Key                    | Value                                                                                                                                                               |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `$id`                  | This is the KILT identity of the CType. It represents the **digital fingerprint** of the CType, making it the most crucial attribute.                                                                      |
| `$schema`              | A reference to the meta-schema that describes how a CType might look. There are two versions.                                                                       |
| `title`                | The title of the CType.                                                                                                                                                   |
| `properties`           | The attributes a claim conforming to this CType can have.                                                                                                         |
| `type`                 | The `type` for all CTypes is an object.                                                                                                                             |
| `additionalProperties` | Set to false by default. This restricts the inclusion of unwanted attributes in a claim.                                                         |

CTypes are stored on the KILT Blockchain.

In real life, we would need to fetch CTypes from an existing repository or chain.

In this workshop, our `Attester` entity will create its own CType and upload it to the test chain.

## Creating a CType

To create a CType, we can establish a structure as shown below:

```typescript title="CTypeSchema"
import * as Kilt from '@kiltprotocol/sdk-js'

// Return CType with the properties matching a given schema.
export function getCTypeSchema(): Kilt.ICType {
  return Kilt.CType.fromProperties('Drivers License', {
    name: {
      type: 'string'
    },
    age: {
      type: 'integer'
    }
  })
}
```

Breaking down how this code works:

- We start by importing the KILT-SDK into our code.
- Next, we define a function named `getCTypeSchema`.
- Finally, we retrieve the necessary information and convert it into a CType using the `CType.fromProperties` function.

## Retrieving the CType

Now, we can write our code to check if the CTypes exist, and if not, create them.

### Adding Libraries

```typescript title="generateCType"
import { config as envConfig } from 'dotenv'
import * as Kilt from '@kiltprotocol/sdk-js'
import { generateAccount } from './generateAccount'
import { generateKeypairs } from './generateKeypairs'
import { getCTypeSchema } from './CTypeSchema'
```

Upon examining the imported packages, we see some familiar ones. The `getCTypeSchema` might catch our eye, which accesses the `getCTypeSchema` method from the previously written `CTypeSchema.ts` file.

### The `ensureStoredCType` Function

```typescript title="generateCType"
export async function ensureStoredCType(
  attesterAccount: Kilt.KiltKeyringPair,
  attesterDid: Kilt.DidUri,
  signCallback: Kilt.SignExtrinsicCallback
): Promise<Kilt.ICType> {
  // ...
}
```

The `ensureStoredCType` function takes three parameters and returns a `Promise`. The function's purpose is to check if a CType (Claim Type) is already registered on the KILT blockchain, and if not, to create it. Looking at these parameters:

1. **`attesterAccount: Kilt.KiltKeyringPair`**: This represents the key pair of the KILT account that will be used to sign transactions.
2. **`attesterDid: Kilt.DidUri`**: Represents the Decentralized Identifier (DID) URI that will be used to authorize transactions.
3. **`signCallback: Kilt.SignExtrinsicCallback`**: This represents the callback function used to sign the transaction.

:::note
`Promise<Kilt.ICType>`: The function returns a `Promise` that delivers the created or already existing CType.
:::

#### Retrieving the KILT API

```typescript title="generateCType"
const api = Kilt.ConfigService.get('api');
```

This retrieves the KILT API, which will be used to interact with the blockchain.

#### Getting the CType Schema

```typescript title="generateCType"
const CType = getCTypeSchema();
```

This retrieves a previously defined CType schema. It fetches this schema from the `CTypeSchema.ts` file we wrote earlier and integrates it into our project.

### Checking if the CType Exists

```typescript title="generateCType"
try {
  await Kilt.CType.verifyStored(CType)
  console.log('CType already stored. Skipping creation')
  return CType
} catch {
  // ...
}
```

The types we're about to create might already exist on the chain. Adding a CType to the chain again would incur unnecessary costs in such cases. To prevent this, we can use the `CType.verifyStored()` method within a `try` block to check if our schema is already stored. The user is informed if it's already stored, and the `CType` is returned.

:::caution If Not Registered?
If the CType isn't registered, the `catch` block will be executed.
:::

#### Creating and Storing the CType

If we're sure the CType isn't on the chain, we can add our created CType to the chain.

```typescript title="generateCType"
console.log('CType not present. Creating it now...');
const encodedCType = Kilt.CType.toChain(CType);
const tx = api.tx.CType.add(encodedCType);

const extrinsic = await Kilt.Did.authorizeTx(
  attesterDid,
  tx,
  signCallback,
  attesterAccount.address
);
await Kilt.Blockchain.signAndSubmitTx(extrinsic, attesterAccount);
return CType;
```

Breaking down the code:

- `encodedCType`: We created the CType as a schema, but we need to encode it in a format that can be added to the chain. We can achieve this with `CType.toChain()`.
- `tx`: To add the CType to the chain, we must prepare its transfer. We can schedule this transfer with the `tx.CType.add` function.
- `extrinsic`: We use this to format the transaction appropriately for interaction with the chain. Since we'll interact with the chain, we must use the `attesterDid` value.
- `signAndSubmitTx`: Finally, we sign the transaction and submit it to the chain.
## Main Code Block

Like the others in the code, this section indicates how the `generateCType.ts` file will operate if directly invoked.

```typescript title="generateCType"
if (require.main === module) {
  ;(async () => {
    // ...
  })()
}
```

We use an `if` structure to check if the code is being run directly. If it is, the code block underneath will execute.

#### Environment Variables and Connection

```typescript title="generateCType"
envConfig()
await Kilt.connect(process.env.WSS_ADDRESS as string)
```

Environment variables are loaded, and a connection is established to the KILT blockchain.

#### Account and DID Creation

```typescript title="generateCType"
const accountMnemonic = process.env.ATTESTER_ACCOUNT_MNEMONIC as string
const { account } = generateAccount(accountMnemonic)
const didMnemonic = process.env.ATTESTER_DID_MNEMONIC as string
const { authentication, assertionMethod } = generateKeypairs(didMnemonic)
const attesterDidUri = Kilt.Did.getFullDidUriFromKey(authentication)
```

An account and DID (Decentralized Identifier) are created using a mnemonic.

#### Calling the `ensureStoredCType` Function

```typescript title="generateCType"
await ensureStoredCType(account, attesterDidUri, async ({ data }) => ({
  signature: assertionMethod.sign(data),
  keyType: assertionMethod.type
}))
```

The `ensureStoredCType` function is called, and the necessary processes are performed.

:::info Let's Take a General Look
Let's look at how the `generateCType.ts` file we wrote operates with all the code together.

```typescript title="generateCType"
import { config as envConfig } from 'dotenv'

import * as Kilt from '@kiltprotocol/sdk-js'

import { generateAccount } from './generateAccount'
import { generateKeypairs } from './generateKeypairs'
import { getCtypeSchema } from './ctypeSchema'

export async function ensureStoredCtype(
  attesterAccount: Kilt.KiltKeyringPair,
  attesterDid: Kilt.DidUri,
  signCallback: Kilt.SignExtrinsicCallback
): Promise<Kilt.ICType> {
  const api = Kilt.ConfigService.get('api')

  // Get the CTYPE and see if it's stored, if yes return it.
  const ctype = getCtypeSchema()
  try {
    await Kilt.CType.verifyStored(ctype)
    console.log('Ctype already stored. Skipping creation')
    return ctype
  } catch {
    console.log('Ctype not present. Creating it now...')
    // Authorize the tx.
    const encodedCtype = Kilt.CType.toChain(ctype)
    const tx = api.tx.ctype.add(encodedCtype)
    const extrinsic = await Kilt.Did.authorizeTx(
      attesterDid,
      tx,
      signCallback,
      attesterAccount.address
    )

    // Write to chain then return the CType.
    await Kilt.Blockchain.signAndSubmitTx(extrinsic, attesterAccount)

    return ctype
  }
}

// Don't execute if another file imports this.
if (require.main === module) {
  ;(async () => {
    envConfig()

    try {
      await Kilt.connect(process.env.WSS_ADDRESS as string)

      const accountMnemonic = process.env.ATTESTER_ACCOUNT_MNEMONIC as string
      const { account } = generateAccount(accountMnemonic)

      const didMnemonic = process.env.ATTESTER_DID_MNEMONIC as string
      const { authentication, assertionMethod } = generateKeypairs(didMnemonic)
      const attesterDidUri = Kilt.Did.getFullDidUriFromKey(authentication)

      await ensureStoredCtype(account, attesterDidUri, async ({ data }) => ({
        signature: assertionMethod.sign(data),
        keyType: assertionMethod.type
      }))
    } catch (e) {
      console.log('Error while checking on chain ctype')
      throw e
    }
  })()
}
```

When examining the code in order:
- We start by importing the necessary packages.
- We fetch our schema from the `CTypeSchema.ts` file and integrate it into our code.
- We check if the CType we want to create is already on the chain.
- If it's not on the chain, we write the code to add it.
- If the file is run on its own, we write the CType operations to be performed.
:::

In this way, we wrote code that checks if the CType we want to create is on the chain and creates it if it's not.

:::danger Don't Forget
We need to pay a deposit to add to the chain. So, we need PILT Coins, don't forget.
:::

## Execution

To run our code, ensure you're in the `kilt-rocks` folder in the terminal, then execute the following command:

```terminal
yarn ts-node attester/generateCType.ts
```

:::caution What's Next?
Alright, now that we've created the CType, we need a `Claimer` individual who will request an `attestation` from us.
