# Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) 🌐

Now that we've set up our account as explained in the previous section, we can start creating a DID for our `Attester`. 🚀

DIDs can represent an individual, organization, or machine. 🧑‍🤝‍🧑🏢🤖

:::caution What are DIDs? 🤔
- In our current system, we have to rely on a central authority (e.g., the government 👮‍♂️) or monopolized services (like Google, Facebook, etc. 🏢) for our digital identity.
- DID stands for Decentralized Identifier. With DIDs, you can be the captain of your digital ship! ⚓️🔗
- It enhances privacy and security. 🕵️‍♂️🔒
:::

KILT DIDs are unique identifiers assigned to each user. 🆔 You can store your DIDs within the KILT chain. 🗃️

:::info KILT DID Encryption Support 🔐
- `Authentication Keypair` 🛡️
- `Key-agreement Keypair` 🤝
- `Assertion-method Keypair` ✅
- `Capability-delegation Keypair` 📝
:::

## Account vs DID 🤷‍♂️

DIDs need to be recorded on the chain. 📝 There's always an account that pays the deposit and initiates the DID verification process. 💰

## Creating a DID 🛠️

:::tip Are All DIDs the Same?

There are 2 types of DIDs we use in KILT. One is the Light DID, while the other is the Full DID.

**Light DID**

Below is an example of a light KILT DID:

```
did:kilt:light:014nv4phaKc4EcwENdRERuMF79ZSSB5xvnAk3zNySSbVbXhSwS
```

Beyond the standard `did:kilt:` prefix, the `light:` component indicates that this DID is a light DID. Therefore, it can be resolved and used offline.

Light DIDs support one of the supported key types as an **encryption key** and optionally services. These are serialized, encoded, and appended to the DID, as follows:

```
did:kilt:light:014nv4phaKc4EcwENdRERuMF79ZSSB5xvnAk3zNySSbVbXhSwS:z1ERkVVjngcarMbJn6YssB1PYULescQneSSEfCTJwYbzT2aK8fzH5WPsp3G4UVuLWWfsTayketnFV74YCnyboHBUvqEs6J8jdYY5dK2XeqCCs653Sf9XVH4RN2WvPrDFZXzzKf3KigvcaE7kkaEwLZvcas3U1M2ZDZCajDG71winwaRNrDtcqkJL9V6Q5yKNWRacw7hJ58d
```

**Full DID**

As mentioned above, creating a full DID requires interaction with the KILT blockchain. Therefore, the DID creation transaction should be sent by a KILT address that has sufficient funds to pay the transaction fees and the required deposit.

Below is an example of a full KILT DID:

```
did:kilt:4rp4rcDHP71YrBNvDhcH5iRoM3YzVoQVnCZvQPwPom9bjo2e
```

There's no `light:` component here, indicating that the DID is a full DID and the keys associated with this DID are not derived from the DID identifier but need to be fetched from the KILT blockchain.

In addition to an authentication key, an encryption key, and services, a full DID also supports an **assertion key** that needs to be used to write CTypes and attestations on the blockchain and a **delegation key** that needs to be used to write delegations on the blockchain.

> **<u> Since we'll be interacting with the chain for our Attester, we'll be creating a `full DID`.</u>**

To create a DID, we can reuse the `keyring` values we used to create the account. 🔄 For the `Attester`, we need four keys. 🔑

### Generating Key Pairs

#### Importing Modules

```typescript title="attester/generateKeypairs.ts"
import * as Kilt from '@kiltprotocol/sdk-js'
import {
  blake2AsU8a,
  keyExtractPath,
  keyFromPath,
  mnemonicGenerate,
  mnemonicToMiniSecret,
  sr25519PairFromSeed
} from '@polkadot/util-crypto'
import { generateAccount } from './generateAccount'
```

As we started with other codes, we first integrated the packages into our project. Looking at our packages one by one:

- First, we integrate the `sdk-js` package into our code to access KILT SDK functions.
- Then, we access several methods from the `polkadot` library to create the `keypair` pairs.
- Finally, we access the `generateAccount` method we exported from the account creation code we wrote on the previous page.

#### `generateKeyAgreement` Function

```typescript title="attester/generateKeypairs.ts"
function generateKeyAgreement(mnemonic: string) {
  const secretKeyPair = sr25519PairFromSeed(mnemonicToMiniSecret(mnemonic))
  const { path } = keyExtractPath('//did//keyAgreement//0')
  const { secretKey } = keyFromPath(secretKeyPair, path, 'sr25519')
  return Kilt.Utils.Crypto.makeEncryptionKeypairFromSeed(blake2AsU8a

(secretKey))
}
```

After loading our packages, we can start creating our key pairs using these packages.

We can start by writing a function to perform this operation. This function will take our mnemonic account key under the name `mnemonic`. Looking at the operations inside one by one:

- __`secretKeyPair`:__ We entered the mnemonic key into the function, but we need to obtain both the public and private keys using this key. First, we enter our `mnemonic` key into the `mnemonicToMiniSecret()` function. This function allows us to obtain another mini key from our key. The newly formed key becomes the `secret` and `public` key pair structure we want with the `sr25519PairFromSeed()` function.
- __`path`:__ After creating our key pair, the next operation is to determine where this key will be stored to create the `secretKey`. At the same time, this operation indicates for what purpose the key will be used. In our code, with the `//did//keyAgreement//0` structure, it is stated that the key will be used as a `key agreement`.
- __`secretKey`:__ This operation takes the two variables we introduced earlier and the wallet type - for us, this value is `sr25519` for now - to create a secret key. This process is implemented with the `keyFromPath` method.
- __`makeEncryptionKeypairFromSeed`:__ Finally, there's the task of outputting the key pairs. We return this operation with the `Utils.Crypto.makeEncryptionKeypairFromSeed()` method in KILT SDK and the function is completed.

:::tip Why Did We Write This Code?
1. **Security**: When creating a decentralized identity system, key agreements are necessary for secure communication.
    
2. **User Control**: By creating their keys, users can control their identities and data.
    
3. **Flexibility**: This function is designed to support different key types, making it suitable for various applications.
    
4. **Integration**: Provides a key creation mechanism compatible with existing blockchain technologies like Kilt and Polkadot.
:::

#### `generateKeypairs` Function

Having previously set up the mechanism to create key pairs with the functions we've defined, we can now define the function required to generate these key pairs. This function will produce four key pairs for us using the secret keys we input.

```typescript title="attester/generateKeypairs.ts"
export function generateKeypairs(mnemonic = mnemonicGenerate()) {
```

We can start by defining our function. This function takes a mnemonic password. However, the structure `mnemonicGenerate()` might be confusing. This structure creates a new mnemonic password if no mnemonic password input is provided.

```typescript title="attester/generateKeypairs.ts"
const { account } = generateAccount(mnemonic);
```

When we enter the code, we first create an account from the `mnemonic` password using the `generateAccount()` function. We will use this account to produce the key pairs later.

:::tip Let's Start Creating the Key Pairs
Now, we can produce our four key pairs.
:::

##### Authentication Key Pair

```typescript title="attester/generateKeypairs.ts"
const authentication = {
  ...account.derive('//did//0'),
  type: 'sr25519'
} as Kilt.KiltKeyringPair;
```

Going line by line:
- `account.derive('//did//0')`: Derives an authentication pair from the account.
- `type: 'sr25519'`: Specifies the type of the key pair.
- `as Kilt.KiltKeyringPair`: Specifies that the type of the key pair is in Kilt's key pair type.

:::info Authentication Keypair Ready!
We've prepared our Authentication key pair. Now, with this key, we can prepare `claims` and present verified `credentials`.
:::

##### Assertion Key Pair

```typescript title="attester/generateKeypairs.ts"
const assertionMethod = {
  ...account.derive('//did//assertion//0'),
  type: 'sr25519'
} as Kilt.KiltKeyringPair;
```

As in the function above, an `Assertion` key pair of type `sr25519` is produced from the account for verifying claims.

##### Capability Delegation Key Pair

```typescript title="attester/generateKeypairs.ts"
const capabilityDelegation = {
  ...account.derive('//did//delegation//0'),
  type: 'sr25519'
} as Kilt.KiltKeyringPair;
```

With our next variable, a key pair is created for delegating capabilities or permissions to another party. This key is used to write `delegations` on the KILT chain.

##### Key Agreement Key Pair

```typescript title="attester/generateKeypairs.ts"
const keyAgreement = generateKeyAgreement(mnemonic);
```

Finally, the `keyAgreement` key pair is produced. This key is used for encrypting and decrypting messages.

##### Returning the Results

```typescript title="attester/generateKeypairs.ts"
return {
  authentication: authentication,
  keyAgreement: keyAgreement,
  assertionMethod: assertionMethod,
  capabilityDelegation: capabilityDelegation
};
```

Finally, we return the key pairs we've created as the function output.

:::danger Key Pair Generation Function Completed!
For the DID we'll create for the Attester, we needed four key pairs. We derived these key pairs with the `generateKeypairs` function.
:::

:::info Let's Review the Entire Code
If we need to see the code we wrote as a whole:
```typescript title="attester/generateKeypairs.ts"
import * as Kilt from '@kiltprotocol/sdk-js'
import {
  blake2AsU8a,
  keyExtractPath,
  keyFromPath,
  mnemonicGenerate,
  mnemonicToMiniSecret,
  sr25519PairFromSeed
} from '@polkadot/util-crypto'
import { generateAccount } from './generateAccount'

// Due to the lack of first-class support for this class of keys,
// we use a workaround to generate a key usable for encryption/decryption.
function generateKeyAgreement(mnemonic: string) {
  const secretKeyPair = sr25519PairFromSeed(mnemonicToMiniSecret(mnemonic))
  const { path } = keyExtractPath('//did//keyAgreement//0')
  const { secretKey } = keyFromPath(secretKeyPair, path, 'sr25519')
  return Kilt.Utils.Crypto.makeEncryptionKeypairFromSeed(blake2AsU8a(secretKey))
}

export function generateKeypairs(mnemonic = mnemonicGenerate()) {
  const { account } = generateAccount(mnemonic)

  const authentication = {
    ...account.derive('//did//0'),
    type: 'sr25519'
  } as Kilt.KiltKeyringPair

  const assertionMethod = {
    ...account.derive('//did//assert

ion//0'),
    type: 'sr25519'
  } as Kilt.KiltKeyringPair

  const capabilityDelegation = {
    ...account.derive('//did//delegation//0'),
    type: 'sr25519'
  } as Kilt.KiltKeyringPair

  const keyAgreement = generateKeyAgreement(mnemonic)

  return {
    authentication: authentication,
    keyAgreement: keyAgreement,
    assertionMethod: assertionMethod,
    capabilityDelegation: capabilityDelegation
  }
}
```

Looking at the operations in order:
- First, we define the necessary libraries.
- Then, we extract some secret keys from the mnemonic password.
- Finally, we define the `generateKeypairs` function and specify all key pairs as the function output.
:::

Now that we've gathered all the keys necessary for creating our DID, we can start creating our DIDs on the chain.

### Creating DID Using Key Pairs

To create a DID, we first need to initiate all processes. Then, we can pull the account we created in the previous section (Attester Account) into our code. This account was created to pay the DID registration fees. Finally, we can announce the necessary transfer to save the DID.

#### Importing Modules

```typescript title="attester/generateDid.ts"
import { config as envConfig } from 'dotenv'
import * as Kilt from '@kiltprotocol/sdk-js'

import { generateAccount } from './generateAccount'
import { generateKeypairs } from './generateKeypairs'
```

As we did before, we add the libraries to our code. Looking at the new and different libraries here:

- `dotenv`: It allows us to load the environment variables we've set (in our case, the mnemonic password, etc.) into our code.
- `generateAccount` and `generateKeypairs`: They allow us to take the functions exported from the codes we previously created in the attester folder.

#### `createFullDid` Function

```typescript title="attester/generateDid.ts"
export async function createFullDid(
  submitterAccount: Kilt.KiltKeyringPair
): Promise<{
  mnemonic: string
  fullDid: Kilt.DidDocument
}> {
```

We can start the processes by defining the function for the DID we will create on the chain. This asynchronous function takes a `submitterAccount` of type `Kilt.KiltKeyringPair` and returns a `Promise`. This `Promise` contains a mnemonic and a `Kilt.DidDocument`.

##### Connecting to Kilt API and Generating Mnemonic

```typescript title="attester/generateDid.ts"
const api = Kilt.ConfigService.get('api')
const mnemonic = Kilt.Utils.Crypto.mnemonicGenerate()
```

Upon entering the function, we are greeted with connecting to the API and generating a `mnemonic` password. DIDs have their unique `mnemonic` passwords. That's why this password is created in this section.

##### Creating Key Pairs

```typescript title="attester/generateDid.ts"
const {
  authentication,
  keyAgreement,
  assertionMethod,
  capabilityDelegation
} = generateKeypairs(mnemonic)
```

In the code file we wrote earlier, we had written the `generateKeypairs` function that allows us to create the necessary key pairs for DIDs. This function outputs four keys and takes a `mnemonic` key. We can call the `generateKeypairs()` function by entering the `mnemonic` key we created in the previous line. As a result of this process, we can save our four passwords to variables in order.

##### Executing the DID Creation Transfer

```typescript title="attester/generateDid.ts"
  const fullDidCreationTx = await Kilt.Did.getStoreTx(
    {
      authentication: [authentication],
      keyAgreement: [keyAgreement],
      assertionMethod: [assertionMethod],
      capabilityDelegation: [capabilityDelegation]
    },
    submitterAccount.address,
    async ({ data }) => ({
      signature: authentication.sign(data),
      keyType: authentication.type
    })
  )
```

We need to make a transfer to create our DIDs. We can perform this transfer using the `getStoreTx()` function found in the `KILT SDK`. Looking at the parameters this function takes:

- Key Pairs: The first parameter takes four keys as an object.
- Account: The next parameter indicates the address to which this account belongs.
- Signature: It performs the necessary signature processes for the transfer.

In this way, the information about the transfer we will send is prepared.

##### Sending the Transaction

```typescript title="attester/generateDid.ts"
await Kilt.Blockchain.signAndSubmitTx(fullDidCreationTx, submitterAccount)
```

After preparing our transfer, we can send our transaction for approval using the `signAndSubmitTx` function.

##### Retrieving Information of the Created DID

```typescript title="attester/generateDid.ts"
const didUri = Kilt.Did.getFullDidUriFromKey(authentication)
const encodedFullDid = await api.call.did.query(Kilt.Did.toChain(didUri))
const { document } = Kilt.Did.linkedInfoFromChain(encodedFullDid)
```

After sending the transfer to create our DID, we can now save the information of the DID created as a result of this transfer to variables. These processes, in order, are:
- Create a URI for the created DID.
- Query the DID document using this URI.

:::caution What is URI?
In DID (Decentralized Identifier) systems, URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) typically allows a DID to be uniquely identified. DID URIs consist of parts such as a "scheme" (e.g., `did:`), a "method" (e.g., `kilt:`), and a "method-specific identifier" (e.g., a blockchain address or another unique identity).

For example, a Kilt DID URI might look like:

```
did:kilt:4uJ7uq1Nj4kZ4qHv3yzZRBuW9D2b3ZRF
```

The parts of this URI are:

- `did:`: This indicates that the URI is a DID.
- `kilt:`: This indicates that the DID uses the Kilt method.
- `4uJ7uq1Nj4kZ4qHv3yzZRBuW9D2b3ZRF`: This is the unique identifier of the DID, usually a blockchain address or another unique identity.

Using this URI, you can typically find out about the keys, capabilities, and other features that the DID has.
:::

##### Error Check and Return Value

```typescript title="attester/generateDid.ts"
if (!document) {
  throw new Error('Full DID was not successfully created.')
}
return { mnemonic, fullDid: document }
```

As we continue our processes, a mechanism that checks whether the DID was created successfully or not greets us. If the DID is created correctly, this URI is returned with the `return` statement.
#### Main Program

Now, we can write the function that indicates what we need to do when the main program runs.

```typescript title="attester/generateDid.ts"
if (require.main === module) {
  ;(async () => {
  envConfig()
```

After defining the function, we retrieve the contents of the `.env` file with the `envConfig()` function.

:::tip
The code file we wrote can both be called by different code files and run on its own. When it's to be used by different files, functions with the `export` structure can be used, but when running on its own, they need the `require.main` structure.
:::

```typescript title="attester/generateDid.ts"
try {

	.
	.
	.
	
} catch (e) {
	console.log("Error while creating attester DID")
	throw e
}	
```

We set up a `try-catch` structure to call the functions. This way, if the codes we write inside the `try` structure don't work, the `catch` statement catches the error and tells us.

Now we can enter the `try` structure.

```typescript title="attester/generateDid.ts"
const accountMnemonic = process.env.ATTESTER_ACCOUNT_MNEMONIC as string
```

First, we add the `attester mnemonic` key we previously created from the `.env` file to our code.

```typescript title="attester/generateDid.ts"
const { account } = generateAccount(accountMnemonic)

const { mnemonic, fullDid } = await createFullDid(account)
```

Then, from this `mnemonic` key, we sequentially call the `generateAccount` and `createFullDid` methods we defined earlier to obtain the `account` and `fullDid` values from this account.

```typescript title="attester/generateDid.ts"
console.log('\nsave following to .env to continue\n');
console.error(`ATTESTER_DID_MNEMONIC="${mnemonic}"\n`);
console.error(`ATTESTER_DID_URI="${fullDid.uri}"\n`);
```

Finally, we provide this information to the user and complete the processes. Our code is completed in this way.

:::info Let's Take a General Look
We wrote our code, but if we need to take a general look at what the `generateDid.ts` file's entire code does:

```typescript title="attester/generateDid.ts"
import { config as envConfig } from 'dotenv'

import * as Kilt from '@kiltprotocol/sdk-js'

import { generateAccount } from './generateAccount'
import { generateKeypairs } from './generateKeypairs'

export async function createFullDid(
  submitterAccount: Kilt.KiltKeyringPair
): Promise<{
  mnemonic: string
  fullDid: Kilt.DidDocument
}> {
  const api = Kilt.ConfigService.get('api')

  const mnemonic = Kilt.Utils.Crypto.mnemonicGenerate()
  const {
    authentication,
    keyAgreement,
    assertionMethod,
    capabilityDelegation
  } = generateKeypairs(mnemonic)
  // Get tx that will create the DID on chain and DID-URI that can be used to resolve the DID Document.
  const fullDidCreationTx = await Kilt.Did.getStoreTx(
    {
      authentication: [authentication],
      keyAgreement: [keyAgreement],
      assertionMethod: [assertionMethod],
      capabilityDelegation: [capabilityDelegation]
    },
    submitterAccount.address,
    async ({ data }) => ({
      signature: authentication.sign(data),
      keyType: authentication.type
    })
  )

  await Kilt.Blockchain.signAndSubmitTx(fullDidCreationTx, submitterAccount)

  const didUri = Kilt.Did.getFullDidUriFromKey(authentication)
  const encodedFullDid = await api.call.did.query(Kilt.Did.toChain(didUri))
  const { document } = Kilt.Did.linkedInfoFromChain(encodedFullDid)

  if (!document) {
    throw new Error('Full DID was not successfully created.')
  }

  return { mnemonic, fullDid: document }
}

// Don't execute if this is imported by another file.
if (require.main === module) {
  ;(async () => {
    envConfig()

    try {
      await Kilt.connect(process.env.WSS_ADDRESS as string)

      // Load attester account
      const accountMnemonic = process.env.ATTESTER_ACCOUNT_MNEMONIC as string
      const { account } = generateAccount(accountMnemonic)
      const { mnemonic, fullDid } = await createFullDid(account)

      console.log('\nsave following to .env to continue\n')
      console.error(`ATTESTER_DID_MNEMONIC="${mnemonic}"\n`)
      console.error(`ATTESTER_DID_URI="${fullDid.uri}"\n`)
    } catch (e) {
      console.log('Error while creating attester DID')
      throw e
    }
  })()
}
```

Looking at what this code does in general:

- We integrate the packages and the codes we wrote earlier into the file.
- We define the `createFullDid()` function and create our key pairs with the `generateKeypairs()` function from the `generateKeypairs.ts` code file.
- With our key pairs, we approve the transfer of our DID to the chain.
- After the transfer, we create the `DID mnemonic key` and `uri` value.
- We run the code file, call the `createFullDid()` function for the `attester mnemonic` key we wrote in the `.env` file, and print the results to the screen.
:::

### Running the Code

To run our code, make sure you are in the `kilt-rocks` location in the terminal, and then you can run the code below.

```terminal
yarn ts-node ./attester/generateDid.ts
```

:::caution Did you get an error?
You might have encountered many errors while running the code, but a commonly encountered error is the user not getting `PILT` coins from the faucet for their `attester` account. Make sure you have enough amount in your account and continue that way!
:::

### Let's Get the Results!

When our code runs, we can see that a new `mnemonic` password and `uri` value have been created for our DID.

:::danger Don't Forget
After running our code, we need to save the resulting Mnemonic and URI values to the `.env` file!
