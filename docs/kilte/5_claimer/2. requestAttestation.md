# Attestation Request üéâ

In this section, we will create a `Claim` and a `Credential`. However, the `Credential` we create is just like a piece of paper for now. üìú Why? Because for it to be reliable for `Validators`, it must be attested by an `Attester`! ü§ù

:::tip üåü Star Tip üåü
Think of KILT as a party that everyone can join! üéâ Anyone or anything can create a `claim` and attest to it. But there's something to keep in mind: If a `Validator` doesn't trust an `Attester`, then that `credential` is just a piece of paper! üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

## üìù Creating a Claim üìù

With the `light DID` we created earlier, the `ctype`, and the information provided by the `Claimer`, we will create a `Claim` object as if creating a recipe. üç≤

:::info ü§î What is a Claim? Let's Dive into the Details ü§î

- As mentioned, you can think of CTypes as a recipe; it tells us what to do. üìëüç≤
  
- So, what happens after we follow the recipe? Does it remain as a recipe? No, of course not! üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è It becomes a dish! üç≤

- Similarly, when we fill the CType with the information we want, it becomes a `Claim`. `Claims` are similar to `Credentials` but have yet to be attested by an Attester. üìùüîê

- `Attesters` play a critical role in this process, just like judges in a cooking competition! ü§© They decide whether to approve or reject the `Credential`. ‚úÖ

- KILT is an open system where anyone can claim anything, even about themselves. üåç However, a `Claim` can only be trusted if it has been attested by an `Attester`. So, `Verifiers` might trust different `Attesters` for different situations. üîçüîí

### Adding Packages

```typescript title="claimer/createClaim.ts"
import * as Kilt from '@kiltprotocol/sdk-js'
```

When adding packages to our file, we can first notice that the only required package is the `KILT-SDK`. Since claims have a simpler structure compared to other formats, this will be sufficient on its own.

### `createClaim` Function

```typescript title="claimer/createClaim.ts"
export function createClaim(
  lightDid: Kilt.DidUri,
  ctype: Kilt.ICType,
  content: Kilt.IClaim['contents']
): Kilt.IClaim {
```

We can set up the function required to create the Claim inside the file. This function takes in 3 parameters. These parameters are:
1. `lightDid: Kilt.DidUri`: The URI of the Light DID. This specifies who created the claim.
2. `ctype: Kilt.ICType`: Specifies which CType (Claim Type) the claim adheres to. In other words, which "form template" is this claim using?
3. `content: Kilt.IClaim['contents']`: The content of the claim, i.e., the information in the filled-out form.

### Creating the Claim

Entering the function, we can create our operation, which will be the `claim` creation action.

```typescript title="claimer/createClaim.ts"
const claim = Kilt.Claim.fromCTypeAndClaimContents(ctype, content, lightDid)
```

When creating the `claim`, the `Kilt.Claim.fromCTypeAndClaimContents()` function is called, and a variable named `claim` is created by entering the parameters into it.

### Returning the Claim

```typescript title="claimer/createClaim.ts"
return claim
```

Finally, the created claim object is returned.

:::info Full Code
If we need to see the entire code together:

```typescript title="claimer/createClaim.ts"
import * as Kilt from '@kiltprotocol/sdk-js'

// Create a Claim object from light DID, CType, and given content.
export function createClaim(
  lightDid: Kilt.DidUri,
  ctype: Kilt.ICType,
  content: Kilt.IClaim['contents']
): Kilt.IClaim {
  const claim = Kilt.Claim.fromCTypeAndClaimContents(ctype, content, lightDid)

  return claim
}
```

This piece of code lays the foundation for creating a `claim`. Once a `claim` is created, it can be attested by an "Attester" and later verified by a "Verifier."
:::

## Creating a Credential

![alternative text](../../../static/img/kilt/credantial%20claim.gif "Overview")

After creating our Claim, we can construct a `Credential` if we want it to be `attested`. We can utilize the `generateCredential` function for this purpose. This Credential will encompass all the necessary information, allowing the `Attester` to `attest` the document.

### Adding Packages

```typescript title="claimer/generateCredential.ts"
import { config as envConfig } from 'dotenv'
import * as Kilt from '@kiltprotocol/sdk-js'
import { createClaim } from './createClaim'
import { generateLightDid } from './generateLightDid'
import { getCtypeSchema } from '../attester/ctypeSchema'
```

Looking at the content of the packages:
- `dotenv`: Used to load environment variables.
- `Kilt`: The KILT protocol SDK.
- `createClaim`, `generateLightDid`, `getCtypeSchema`: Helper functions defined in previous code snippets.

### `generateCredential` Function

```typescript title="claimer/generateCredential.ts"
export function generateCredential(
  claimerDid: Kilt.DidUri,
  claimAttributes: Kilt.IClaim['contents']
): Kilt.ICredential {
```

We can start by writing the necessary function to create a Credential. This function will take in 2 parameters and return an output of type `Kilt.ICredential`. Looking at the parameters one by one:
- `claimerDid`: Takes in the Light DID created by the Claimer.
- `claimAttributes`: Contains a list of claimed attributes.

### Creating the Claim and CType

```typescript title="claimer/generateCredential.ts"
const ctype = getCtypeSchema()
const claim = createClaim(claimerDid, ctype, claimAttributes)
```

We had written the code to create both the `ctype` and the `claim` and imported them into our file. We can use these functions first to retrieve the CType schema and then call the `claim` creation function. So, in order:
- `getCtypeSchema()`: Retrieves a previously defined CType schema.
- `createClaim()`: Creates a claim (`Claim`) using the specified CType and attributes.

### Creating the Credential

```typescript title="claimer/generateCredential.ts"
console.log('Claimer -> create request')
return Kilt.Credential.fromClaim(claim)
```

With our beautiful little `Credential.fromClaim()` code, we can create a `Credential` from the `Claim`.

### Main Code Block

This section provides the operations performed if the file is run independently.

```typescript title="claimer/generateCredential.ts"
if (require.main === module) {
	.
	.
	.
  })()
}
```

As mentioned above, the `if` structure checks if the code runs independently.

```typescript title="claimer/generateCredential.ts"
envConfig()
```

With this function, we add the environment variables from the `.env` file into the code.

```typescript title="claimer/generateCredential.ts"
    try {
		.
		.
		.
    } catch (e) {
      console.log('Error while building credential')
      throw e
    }
```

A `try-catch` structure is set up for the function to run. If there's an error in the operations, the error is printed to the screen using the `log` structure.

Within the `try` structure, the `credential` form can be set up.

```typescript title="claimer/generateCredential.ts"
await Kilt.init()
```

Upon entering the `try` structure, we can add the KILT SDK to the project with the `Kilt.init` structure.

#### Retrieving the Mnemonic Key

```typescript title="claimer/generateCredential.ts"
const claimerDidMnemonic = process.env.CLAIMER_DID_MNEMONIC as string
```

It retrieves the `CLAIMER_DID_MNEMONIC` from the environment variables and stores it as a string.

#### Creating the Light DID

```typescript title="claimer/generateCredential.ts"
const claimerDid = generateLightDid(claimerDidMnemonic)
```

Using the `generateLightDid` function, we defined in another code file earlier, it creates a `light DID` from the mnemonic.

### Creating the Credential

```typescript title="claimer/generateCredential.ts"
const request = generateCredential(claimerDid.uri, 
								   { age: 21, 
								   name: 'Aybars G√∂ktuƒü Ayan' 
								   })
								   
console.log('‚ö†Ô∏è   Save to ./claimer/_credential.json file  ‚ö†Ô∏è\n\n')
console.log(JSON.stringify(request, null, 2))
```

Finally, with the `generateCredential` function, we fill in the `claim` and convert it to the `credential` format. This function creates a credential using the generated DID and specified attributes (`age` and `name`). Then, it prints the created identity information in JSON format to the console.

:::info Overview
If we look at the entire code:
```typescript title="claimer/generateCredential.ts"
import { config as envConfig } from 'dotenv'

import * as Kilt from '@kiltprotocol/sdk-js'

import { createClaim } from './createClaim'
import { generateLightDid } from './generateLightDid'
import { getCtypeSchema } from '../attester/ctypeSchema'

export function generateCredential(
  claimerDid: Kilt.DidUri,
  claimAttributes: Kilt.IClaim['contents']
): Kilt.ICredential {
  // Create claim.
  const ctype = getCtypeSchema()
  const claim = createClaim(claimerDid, ctype, claimAttributes)

  // Create credential and request attestation.
  console.log('Claimer -> create request')
  return Kilt.Credential.fromClaim(claim)
}

// Don't execute if this is imported by another file.
if (require.main === module) {
  ;(async () => {
    envConfig()

    try {
      await Kilt.init()

      const claimerDidMnemonic = process.env.CLAIMER_DID_MNEMONIC as string
      const claimerDid = generateLightDid(claimerDidMnemonic)

      const request = generateCredential(claimerDid.uri, {
        age: 21,
        name: 'Aybars G√∂ktuƒü Ayan'
      })
      console.log(
        '‚ö†Ô∏è  save this to ./claimer/_credential.json for testing  ‚ö†Ô∏è\n\n'
      )
      console.log(JSON.stringify(request, null, 2))
    } catch (e) {
      console.log('Error while building credential')
      throw e
    }
  })()
}
```
If we examine it step by step:
- We added the packages.
- We create a Claim.
- We create a Credential with the Claim and register it on the chain.

## Running the Program

To run the 2 interconnected codes we wrote, make sure you are in the `kilt-rocks` folder and then you can run the code below.

```terminal
yarn ts-node claimer/generateCredential.ts
```

---

:::caution
Attestations are recorded on the chain after they are approved by the `Attesters`. This process requires a deposit. Each Credential is unique. Generally, by storing and reusing `credentials` during testing, we prevent multiple `attestation` processes.

To save this document, you can create a file at `./claimer/_credential.json` and write the information inside. You can even share this `credential` with your friends and let them use it.
:::

:::info Well done to us
Yes, now as a `Claimer`, we have created a `Claim` and generated a `credential` from this `Claim`. Let's complete the attester and get the `credential` attested.
