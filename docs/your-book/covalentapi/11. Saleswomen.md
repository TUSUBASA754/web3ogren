# Saleswomen

Here's a narrative that merges the world of Covalent and its features with the life of a passionate saleswoman named Clara.

In the bustling streets of Barcelona, Clara owned a renowned boutique, "Cadenza", which sold a variety of goods from artisans all over the world. Her boutique was more than just a store; it was an amalgamation of diverse cultures and tales, not unlike the way Covalent brings together different blockchains.

**Covalent's Unified API**: 
Clara had a unique system, "CovaCatalog", that listed every item in her store. Just as Covalent offers a unified API for blockchain data, CovaCatalog gave Clara a unified view of all her products, from intricate Italian jewelry to handcrafted Moroccan lamps, allowing her to provide customers with information effortlessly.

**Blockchain Data**: 
The variety of items Clara sold were sourced from different suppliers and artisans, akin to the diverse blockchains aggregated by Covalent. Every item in Clara's store had a unique story, and through CovaCatalog, she could narrate these tales to her customers, enhancing their shopping experience.

**Difference between JSON-RPC and Covalent**: 
In the past, Clara maintained separate ledgers for each type of product, reminiscent of the limited scope of JSON-RPC. With CovaCatalog, she could access all her data simultaneously, streamlining her sales process much like Covalent's Unified API.

**API Endpoints**: 
For exclusive customers looking for tailored suggestions, Clara could filter CovaCatalog to show only specific types of products, paralleling Covalent's custom API endpoints.

**Error Messages**: 
When a product was out of stock or there was a mismatch in inventory, CovaCatalog would alert Clara, ensuring she was always informed and could rectify issues promptly.

Introducing **CQT Tokens**:
To incentivize repeat customers and build loyalty, Clara introduced Boutique Credits (BC), her version of CQT tokens. These credits could be earned with each purchase and used for exclusive discounts, early access to new collections, or even special events.

**Governance and Proposals**: 
The most loyal customers, those holding significant Boutique Credits, were given a say in upcoming collections or store events. Clara valued their feedback and often organized focus groups, where BC holders could vote on new product lines or seasonal themes, mirroring CQT's governance mechanism.

**Staking and Fees**: 
For artisans wanting to showcase their products at Cadenza, Clara introduced a unique model. They could "stake" a number of their Boutique Credits in the store, which would then be returned to them with a bonus based on sales, incentivizing quality and exclusive products.

**Network Access**: 
New customers, upon registering on CovaCatalog, received a small number of Boutique Credits, encouraging them to explore more and become part of the Cadenza family.

Every day, as Clara interacted with customers and introduced them to the world of Cadenza, she felt a connection akin to the bond between Covalent and its users. With CovaCatalog and Boutique Credits, she not only boosted her sales but also created an engaged community around her boutique.
