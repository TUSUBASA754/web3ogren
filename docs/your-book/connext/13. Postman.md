# Postman

Visualize a postman, tasked with the critical job of delivering letters and packages to numerous destinations, each destination bearing unique characteristics and guidelines, akin to individual blockchains. The challenge of accurately delivering items across these varying locations parallels the complexity of transferring data or value across diverse blockchains.

In this picture, Connext serves as an advanced postal system, facilitating smooth and reliable delivery between different destinations. It interprets each destination's unique language and delivery protocol, enabling the postman to complete his job efficiently and reliably.

The 'Offchain Agents' are akin to postal workers that assist the postman in his duties. Routers are the route planners, ensuring the most efficient paths for delivery. Sequencers function like sorting machines, determining the order in which the postman delivers his items. Relayers act as the post office clerks, ensuring every parcel is correctly registered and sent to the right location.

The 'Clusters' in the Connext ecosystem could be likened to different postal zones, each with its unique rules for package handling and delivery. Each has its special delivery protocols, but together, they form a comprehensive postal network.

Finally, the 'xERC20' tokens are similar to postal stamps, a universal currency for sending parcels. These tokens, much like stamps, retain their value regardless of their destination, ensuring security and ease of transactions across the postal network.

Just as a well-functioning postal system ensures efficient and secure delivery of parcels, Connext ensures a smooth, efficient, and secure blockchain ecosystem. It simplifies the intimidating task of transferring data and value across blockchains, making it as straightforward as posting a letter or parcel.
