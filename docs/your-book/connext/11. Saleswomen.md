# Saleswomen

Picture a bustling marketplace where a saleswoman navigates various stalls, each representing a different blockchain. Each stall has its own language, items for sale, and payment methods. The challenge of transacting across these stalls mirrors the complexity of transferring data or value across diverse blockchains.

Connext functions like a universal translator and currency exchanger in this bustling marketplace. It comprehends each stall's unique language and trading protocol, making it possible for the saleswoman to buy and sell goods effortlessly between different stalls.

Think of 'Offchain Agents' as the marketplace assistants, helping to facilitate transactions. Routers help the saleswoman find the best routes to her desired stalls, sequencers keep track of her buying and selling orders, while relayers ensure the transactions are correctly recorded and exchanged.

The 'Clusters' are akin to different sections of the marketplace, each dedicated to specific types of goods - food, clothing, electronics, and more. Each has its unique trading rules, but together they form a comprehensive marketplace.

Finally, the 'xERC20' tokens can be seen as a universal currency accepted by all the stalls. These tokens maintain their value, no matter where they are used, ensuring security and ease of trade across the marketplace.

As a universal translator and currency exchanger makes trading in a bustling marketplace seamless, Connext ensures a smooth, efficient, and secure blockchain ecosystem, making the intimidating task of transferring data and value across blockchains as simple as buying and selling goods in a marketplace.
