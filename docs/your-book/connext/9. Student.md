# Student

Think back to when you were a student. You likely attended various classes, each having its own unique set of rules, language, and curriculum - like different blockchains in the Connext network. You needed to understand the requirements of each to ensure your success.

To navigate the vast and complex educational system, Connext can be seen as the guidance counselor - understanding each course's unique language and protocol, and facilitating seamless transfer of knowledge (data or value) across various classes (blockchains).

The 'Offchain Agents' such as routers, sequencers, and relayers, function like school administrators, librarians, and teachers. Routers help you find the quickest route to gather knowledge, sequencers maintain the order of your class schedule, and relayers ensure the information you've learned is properly stored and can be accessed when needed.

Consider the 'Clusters' as different schools within the district. They may have unique rules, languages, and ways of teaching, but together, they form the cohesive and unified educational system.

Finally, the 'xERC20' tokens are like the grades you earn in each class. They carry the same value across different classes and can be used to measure your overall academic performance.

In this analogy, Connext plays the vital role of a guidance counselor, ensuring you navigate smoothly through the complex educational system, ultimately leading to your academic success. Just like how Connext ensures an efficient and secure blockchain ecosystem.
