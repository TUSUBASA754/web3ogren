# Pilot

Imagine a pilot, navigating a complex network of flight paths, coordinating with various air traffic controls, ensuring smooth transitions from one airspace to another, akin to blockchains communicating with one another. The task of guiding a plane seamlessly between airspaces aligns with the challenge of moving data and funds between different blockchains.

Connext here serves as the flight navigation system that interprets the unique air traffic control language of each airspace, ensuring a safe and efficient journey between various destinations.

The 'Offchain Agents' play the roles similar to the ground crew. Routers can be likened to air traffic controllers, guiding the plane through the complex flight paths. Sequencers function as the flight plan, outlining the best route for the journey. Relayers serve as communication links between the pilot and the ground, ensuring that every instruction and detail is accurately relayed.

The 'Clusters' in the Connext ecosystem mirror the different airspaces that a plane flies through, each with their unique rules and communication methods. The 'xERC20' tokens operate like the international flight tickets that hold their value regardless of the destination, ensuring a secure and standardized transaction across different airlines.

Just as a skilled pilot ensures a safe and efficient flight, Connext guarantees a smooth and secure journey across the blockchain ecosystem. It turns the daunting task of moving data and funds across blockchains into an easy and straightforward process, akin to a well-planned flight.
