# Librarian

Consider the work of a librarian, who is responsible for managing and organising a variety of books across different categories, each with its unique codes and classifications. The world of blockchain is not very different, with each chain having its unique characteristics and language.

Transferring data or value from one blockchain to another is like moving a book from one category to another. While this seems simple, each section has its own classification system, rules, and language. It's like trying to move a novel from fiction to mystery, but each section uses a different cataloguing system.

Here, Connext functions like an excellent library management system that allows librarians to effortlessly move books (or in blockchain terms, data and funds) from one section to another without worrying about different cataloguing systems.

Think of 'Offchain Agents' as your library's staff. Routers are like the staff who know the fastest way to move a book from one section to another. Sequencers are like those in charge of organising the check-in and check-out process. And Relayers are like assistants who help move books between sections, ensuring that every book finds its rightful place.

'Clusters' in the Connext ecosystem can be compared to different sections in the library. Each section, such as fiction, mystery, or biographies, has a unique purpose, but together they ensure the library functions seamlessly.

'xERC20' tokens are similar to the library cards that patrons use to check out books. These tokens can be transferred across chains without compromising security, just like how a library card can be used to check out books from any section.

Just as you ensure that the library functions smoothly, Connext works to ensure the blockchain ecosystem is efficient and secure. It simplifies the complex process of transferring data and funds across multiple blockchains. It's like having a universal library system that makes managing the vast library a breeze.
