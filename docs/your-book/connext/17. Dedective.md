# Detective

Imagine a detective, meticulously deciphering complex clues from various cases, each with its unique narrative and context. This task is parallel to the challenge of interoperating between different blockchains.

In this setting, Connext is the sophisticated toolset that helps the detective to interpret and link clues from various cases. It enables the detective to understand the unique language of each case and discover connections between them.

In the Connext ecosystem, 'Offchain Agents' act like the detective's trusty aides. Routers are akin to the informants that provide crucial information. Sequencers function as the detective's case board, outlining the sequence of events in the cases. Relayers act as messengers, ensuring that every clue and piece of information is accurately communicated.

'Clusters' in the Connext ecosystem mirror different cases that a detective handles, each with its unique narrative. 'xERC20' tokens act like evidence pieces that hold their significance regardless of the case, ensuring a secure and standardized transaction across different investigations.

Just like a skilled detective unraveling complex cases, Connext ensures a smooth and efficient operation across the blockchain ecosystem. It turns the formidable task of transferring data and value across blockchains into a straightforward process, akin to solving a mystery.
