These instruments enabled him to deliver justice by blending the traditions of Ethereum with the principles of Polkadot.

### **Unified Legal Traditions**

As his career advanced, Justus recognized the value in understanding and combining the legal traditions of both Ethereum and Polkadot. This led him to pioneer `Cross-jurisdictional trials` and `XC-20 legal procedures`, harmonizing the best of both worlds.
