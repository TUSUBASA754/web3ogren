# Researcher

Dr. Lydia spends her days deep in research, striving to push the boundaries of human knowledge. The tools and methods she employs offer a compelling lens through which to view Agoric's world.

1. **Agoric Wallet** - For Lydia, her **research database** acts as the Agoric Wallet. Just as the wallet safely stores digital assets, her database securely contains her invaluable research data, findings, and notes.

2. **Dapps (Decentralized applications)** - These are like the various **research methodologies** she employs. Each methodology, similar to a Dapp, has specific objectives and ways of obtaining results, guiding her investigations.

3. **Ag-Solo** - This is analogous to her **private lab**. A space where she can run specialized experiments, much like how an Ag-Solo offers a tailored Agoric environment.

4. **Petnames and Paths** - They resonate with her system of **labelling samples and experiments**. Just as petnames offer personalized references in Agoric, her labels provide a clear system to identify and trace her work.

5. **ERTP (Electronic Rights Transfer Protocol)** - It's reminiscent of the **standardized procedures** in her field. As ERTP provides a uniform way to handle tokens, these procedures ensure consistency and reliability in her research results.

6. **Zoe** - To Lydia, Zoe is akin to the **peer review process**. As authors submit their findings, the process ensures that the results are reliable and trustworthy, paralleling Zoe's guarantee of transactional integrity.

7. **Endo/Hardened JS** - Reflects the **protected research journals and databases** she accesses. These are vetted sources that offer accurate and tamper-proof information, much like the security Hardened JS provides.

8. **Tendermint** - It mirrors the **research symposiums** she attends. At these gatherings, a consensus on new findings and theories is often pursued, akin to how Tendermint reaches consensus in the blockchain realm.

9. **CapTP** - Is reminiscent of the **secure communication channels** she uses with other researchers. Through these channels, they share proprietary data and collaborate on projects, ensuring confidentiality.

10. **IBC (Inter-Blockchain Communication)** - To Lydia, this is like **international research collaborations**. Just as IBC enables communication between different blockchains, these collaborations foster the exchange of insights and data between researchers from different regions.

As Dr. Lydia delves deeper into her research journey, these parallels provide an insightful bridge between the meticulous world of research and the innovative universe of Agoric's blockchain technology.
