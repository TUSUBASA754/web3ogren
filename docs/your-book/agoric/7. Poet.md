# Poet

In the serene heart of a city, Eleanor, a renowned poet, weaves words into magic, creating verses that tug at heartstrings. The world of poetry, with its rhythm and metaphors, shares surprising similarities with Agoric's blockchain technologies.

1. **Agoric Wallet** - For Eleanor, her **notebook** serves this purpose. It's the sacred space where she pens her drafts, guards her most cherished lines, and reflects upon her thoughts, much like how the wallet securely manages assets in Agoric.

2. **Dapps (Decentralized applications)** - These are like **poetry workshops and readings** she attends. At these gatherings, she interacts, shares her work, gets feedback, and collaborates on anthologies, akin to how Dapps interact with the blockchain.

3. **Ag-Solo** - Reminds her of her **solitary writing desk**. Here, she delves deep into her thoughts, creates, and revises. It's her personal space, just like how an Ag-Solo acts as a unique entry point in the Agoric System.
