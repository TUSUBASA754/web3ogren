1. **Agoric Wallet** - To Eliza, this is her **cash register**. It's where she securely stores the earnings from her customers and schedules her upcoming appointments. Just as the Agoric Wallet secures digital assets, Eliza's register keeps her earnings safe and organized.

2. **Dapps (Decentralized applications)** - These are akin to the **appointment booking apps** her clients use to reserve slots with her. Each app caters to different customer needs, much like Dapps that offer varied decentralized functionalities.

3. **Ag-Solo** - This reminds Eliza of her **personalized set of hair tools**. Each tool has a specific function and enables her to interact uniquely with every client's hair, similar to how Ag-Solo manages personal interactions within Agoric.

4. **Petnames and Paths** - For Eliza, these are the **unique names** she gives to her signature hairstyles, making it easier for her and her clients to reference, just as petnames in Agoric provide a unique reference for assets.

5. **ERTP (Electronic Rights Transfer Protocol)** - This is like the **price list** Eliza displays at her salon. It clearly indicates the cost of each service, ensuring transparent transactions based on the service rendered.

6. **Zoe** - To Eliza, Zoe feels like the **customer reviews and feedback** section on her website. It ensures transparency in what clients have experienced, ensuring future clients get what they've seen and read about.

7. **Endo/Hardened JS** - For her, this is the **sterilization process** for her tools. After each use, they're cleaned and sterilized, ensuring a safe and hygienic environment for every client, just as Endo provides a secure environment for contracts.

8. **Tendermint** - Eliza likens this to the **hairdresser workshops** she attends, where professionals share techniques, discuss trends, and make decisions about industry standards, mirroring Tendermint's consensus mechanism.

9. **CapTP** - This, to Eliza, is the **intercom system** in her salon, ensuring she receives clear messages about which client is ready or if a new appointment has been made.

10. **IBC (Inter-Blockchain Communication)** - She likens this to the **networking events and hair shows** she attends in various cities. Just as IBC connects different blockchains, these events allow her to connect with other professionals and trends from different places.

To Ms. Eliza, every client's hair tells a story, has its own identity. Similarly, Agoric provides a platform that respects individuality and ensures a secure and interconnected digital experience for all.
