# Saleswomen

Miss Evelyn is a top saleswoman, managing a vast portfolio of products, clients, and sales strategies. The world of sales is full of dynamics, interactions, and strategies, much like the world of Agoric.

1. **Agoric Wallet** - For Evelyn, her **customer database** is the Agoric Wallet. Just like the wallet holds assets, her database holds information about every client, their preferences, and their purchase history.

2. **Dapps (Decentralized applications)** - These are similar to the **sales tools and platforms** Evelyn uses to manage leads, track sales, and forecast her targets. Each tool, like a Dapp, has its unique purpose and functionality tailored to specific sales needs.

3. **Ag-Solo** - This reflects her **personal workspace**, a tailored environment where she drafts pitches, strategizes, and hones her selling points, akin to how an Ag-Solo offers a customized Agoric environment.

4. **Petnames and Paths** - They resonate with the **nicknames and notes** she has for each client. These personal touches help her remember details and build relationships, just as petnames in Agoric provide personalized asset references.

5. **ERTP (Electronic Rights Transfer Protocol)** - This is much like her **standard sales protocols**. Whether she's closing a deal or addressing a client's concern, these standard approaches ensure consistency and quality in her sales process.

6. **Zoe** - To Evelyn, Zoe mirrors the **contracts and agreements** she signs with clients. Just as Zoe ensures a safe exchange in transactions, her contracts assure both parties of mutual commitments.

7. **Endo/Hardened JS** - Itâ€™s akin to the **secure sales portals** she uses. These platforms guarantee that client data, transactions, and communications are safe and tamper-proof.

8. **Tendermint** - Reflects her **team meetings and brainstorming sessions**. Here, strategies are discussed, and consensus on the best sales approaches is reached, resembling Tendermint's consensus mechanism.

9. **CapTP** - Reminds Evelyn of her **secure client communication channels**. Through these, she ensures her communications are confidential, especially when discussing deals or offers.

10. **IBC (Inter-Blockchain Communication)** - For Evelyn, this is like her **networking at international sales conferences**. Just as IBC facilitates communication between diverse blockchains, these conferences enable her to connect with sales professionals globally, exchanging strategies and leads.

With each sale, Evelyn tactically navigates the intricacies of her role. Drawing these analogies helps bridge the dynamic world of sales with the groundbreaking aspects of Agoric's blockchain technology.
