# Postman

Mrs. Clara starts her day early, sorting through letters, parcels, and packages, readying them for delivery. As she navigates her route, her experiences intertwine with the facets of the Agoric platform.

1. **Agoric Wallet** - This is similar to Clara's **official postbag**, where she keeps all the letters and parcels securely. It ensures the items are safe, just like how the Agoric Wallet stores digital assets.

2. **Dapps (Decentralized applications)** - These can be compared to the **different types of mail services** Clara offers: standard mail, express, registered, or international. Each service is tailored for a specific need, just as Dapps serve distinct decentralized functions.

3. **Ag-Solo** - For Clara, this is her **daily delivery route chart**. It's personal, planned, and provides a clear path for her daily journey, reflecting an individual's interaction with Agoric.

4. **Petnames and Paths** - Clara thinks of these as her **special shortcuts and nicknames** for certain houses or streets. These unique identifiers help her remember her route, just like petnames in Agoric aid in recalling specific assets.

5. **ERTP (Electronic Rights Transfer Protocol)** - This reminds Clara of the **barcode scans** she does for each parcel, ensuring they are delivered to the right address without errors.

6. **Zoe** - To Clara, Zoe symbolizes the **delivery receipts** she collects from recipients, confirming the successful and accurate delivery of mail.

7. **Endo/Hardened JS** - This is like Clara's **raincoat and protective gear** â€“ essential tools that shield her and her mail from adverse weather conditions, analogous to the secure environment that Endo provides for smart contracts.

8. **Tendermint** - Clara sees this as her **morning team briefings** with fellow postmen and postwomen. Together, they discuss daily challenges, share experiences, and make collective decisions.

9. **CapTP** - To Clara, this is like the **secure intercom system** at her postal office. It ensures that sensitive information or special instructions about deliveries are communicated securely and privately.

10. **IBC (Inter-Blockchain Communication)** - Clara likens this to the **postal exchange systems** between different countries. Just as IBC connects different blockchains, the postal exchange system allows her to send and receive mail globally, bridging distances and connecting people.

For Mrs. Clara, every letter and package carries a story, a connection. Similarly, Agoric's platform isn't just about technology; it's about connecting diverse digital assets and systems in a secure, seamless manner.
