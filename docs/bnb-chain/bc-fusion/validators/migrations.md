# Validator Migration Guide

The introduction of [native staking](https://github.com/bnb-chain/BEPs/blob/master/BEPs/BEP294.md) on the BNB Smart Chain marks a significant milestone, enabling validators to be directly created and managed on the chain. Following the Feynman hardfork, validators initially established on the BNB Beacon Chain are required to migrate to the BNB Smart Chain to continue their operations.

**Important Note:** Ensuring a timely migration is crucial for uninterrupted validator operations.

To migrate your validator, you can take the following steps:

## 1. Create a new validator

The Staking dApp offers a user-friendly interface for creating a new validator on the BNB Smart Chain. Follow the detailed instructions in the `validator creation guide` to set up your new validator. It's crucial to populate the `Identity` field as specified in the guide to ensure a successful migration.

## 2. Migrate stakes to the new validator

Once your new validator is active, inform your delegators about the migration. They will need to migrate their stakes to your new validator to continue supporting you. For comprehensive details on stake migration, refer to the `stake migration guide`.

To effectively migrate stakes, **delegators** are required to follow specific steps outlined in the stake migration guide. It's essential to communicate the migration process clearly to avoid any loss of support during this transition.
