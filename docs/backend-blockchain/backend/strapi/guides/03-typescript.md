## Key Features

- **Static Typing**: TypeScriptâ€™s static type system helps identify errors during development rather than at runtime.
- **Type Inference**: Even without explicit type annotations, TypeScript can deduce variable types.
- **Interfaces**: TypeScript allows defining interfaces for objects, enhancing code readability and maintainability.

2. **Enhanced IDE Support**: Most IDEs provide better autocompletion and refactoring tools when using TypeScript.
3. **Scalability**: TypeScript is a great choice for large codebases due to its maintainability features.
