# Solidity Nedir?

Solidity is a statically typed programming language designed for developing smart contracts that run on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).

Solidity uses ECMAScript-like syntax which makes it familiar for existing web developers;[citation needed] however unlike ECMAScript it has static typing and variadic return types. Solidity is different from other EVM-targeting languages such as Serpent and Mutan in some important ways. It supports complex member variables for contracts, including arbitrarily hierarchical mappings and structs. Solidity contracts support inheritance, including multiple inheritances with C3 linearization. Solidity introduces an application binary interface (ABI) that facilitates multiple type-safe functions within a single contract (this was also later supported by Serpent). The Solidity proposal also includes "Natural Language Specification", a documentation system for specifying user-centric descriptions of the ramifications of method-calls.
